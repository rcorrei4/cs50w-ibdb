**This is my capstone project that I made for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript 2020 course**

# IBDb
IBDb is a collaborative library editing, you can create a page for a book and anyone can help improving the page, it was inspired by the collaborative editing form of wikipedia, where all users can edit a wiki and thus form quality content. The name was totally inspired by the IMDb (Internet Movie Database).

## Extra
There were other projects during the course, but as far as I remember, CS50 did not recommend sharing these projects because they were the same for other people, which would facilitate plagiarism. However you can view each project requirements:
